Hello Rba,

NOTE: I'm not able to find your email address to contact you. So, I am adding text file.

Monitor:name: DELL U2720Q
INPUT1:MAC-HDMI
INPUT2:WINDOWS-USB-C


Firstly, I want to thank  you for the wrapper to ddcctl.
I have a few blockers while exec file- I have update
my @default_inputs = qw{ 27 17 }; to switch b/w USB-C and HDMI.
But, for some reason when i execute file sys giving following values on
current input: 15
next input: 17 and i debugged code
line#38 (i.e @inputs = $config =~ m{(\d+)}g;) config
returning values as 15 and 17 - why still config is returning 15 and 17 - what suggestions you will give to make it work b/w HDMI and USB-C
. Help or directions greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
-Ashok
